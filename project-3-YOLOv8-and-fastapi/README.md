### Additional info:
1 - preferrably use python v3.9 as higher versions cause dependency conflicts. To start, run in cmd:
```
python yolofastapi/main.py
```

2 - run the application 'main.py' and in a browser (for ex: chrome) run:
```
http://localhost/docs  
```

3 - consider testing with png images as thats what the type set here... otherwise modify the code to suite your needs
